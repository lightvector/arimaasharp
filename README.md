This repo is a public archive of the source code for bot_sharp, a project that was started all the way back in 2007, and which by 2015 became the strongest available bot for the game Arimaa: [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/](http://arimaa.com/arimaa/). Since then, Sharp has been superseded by much stronger and more advanced bots written by others based on deep learning and/or AlphaZero-style methods.

Compiled binaries can be found here: http://arimaa.com/arimaa/forum/cgi/YaBB.cgi?board=devTalk;action=display;num=1526353703

The release of this code is mostly to make it available out of historical interest. No further development is planned, and no support is being provided to users wishing to run the above binaries or wishing to compile and run it from source.
